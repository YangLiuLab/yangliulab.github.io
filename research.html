                     <h3>Overview</h3>
                     <hr>
                     <p> The laboratory of Dr. Yang Liu focuses on developing multiscale multimodal optical microscopy techniques spanning seven orders of magnitude, 
                        bridging the nanoscale to the mesoscale, to significantly advance precision medicine such as early detection, prevention, and treatment of cancer. 
                        The technologies integrate label-free quantitative phase imaging with hyper-plex mesoscale microscopy, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, 
                        and highly sensitive and specific across-the-scale imaging probes, which are paired with artificial intelligence (AI), robotic automation, and 
                        large-scale image informatics. This transformative approach allows for dynamic high-content phenotyping and provides invaluable insights into the 
                        molecular changes under complex tissue microenvironments. This is critical in understanding the progression from precursors to invasive cancer 
                        and deciphering the mechanisms behind therapeutic resistance. The fusion of cross-scale imaging with AI-driven systems biology and automation is 
                        poised to drive future scientific discoveries and transform personalized medicine. Here is a recent <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Id--O-L02riyZRW3M3c5NZ54fIZdteeR/view?usp=drive_link">poster</a></b> summarizing our research.

                              Spatial biology offers transformative insights into cellular function within microenvironments, pivotal for precision medicine. Our multiscale 
                              multimodal imaging platform is tailored for quantitative spatiotemporal biology. This platform seamlessly integrates quantitative phase, 
                              hyper-plex fluorescence imaging, and a wide field-of-view with sub-micron resolution. It also co-registers mesoscale images with 
                              molecular-scale super-resolution images and whole-slide histology images, bridging molecular information with mesoscale cell sociology and 
                              tissue contexts. This platform will serve as a powerful tool to enhance spatial biology by allowing rapid and comprehensive profiling of 
                              mesoscale microenvironment and spatial heterogeneity, temporal dynamics of cell morphology and their underlying functional and molecular 
                              characteristics over a large cell population in cells under different treatments and tissue at various pathological conditions.

                              Advances in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy have revolutionized biological imaging by overcoming the fundamental diffraction barrier, recognized by a Nobel Prize in 2014. 
                              In particular, single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) such as (fluorescence) photo-activated localization microscopy [(f)PALM] and (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction 
                              microscopy [(d)STORM] is one of the simplest and most cost-effective approaches to achieve super-resolved imaging capability at a spatial resolution down to 5-10 nm. 
                              Despite its impact, it is generally deemed as a complex and low-throughput technique. The main rate-limiting factors are the small illumination field, the need to acquire 
                              tens of thousands of imaging frames to reconstruct an image and slow image reconstruction speed. It is also limited to imaging thin and transparent samples (bacteria, cultured 
                              cells). We aim to develop multi-color high-throughput STORM system that can be used to analyze clinically relevant pathological samples and apply machine-learning tools for 
                              automated analysis.

                              Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) offers a label-free approach to non-invasively characterize cellular processes by exploiting their refractive index-based intrinsic contrast. 
                              QPI captures this contrast by translating refractive index-associated phase shifts into intensity-based quantifiable data with nanoscale sensitivity. The integration of 
                              spatial biology, multi-omics, and artificial intelligence with QPI’s precise and unbiased mapping of tissue architecture and nanoscale details could serve as the 
                              next-generation approach in advancing precision medicine through label-free disease diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment.

                              Nanoscale nuclear architecture mapping (nanoNAM) is an  interferometry approach to capture the sub-resolution nanoscale structural alterations within the cell nucleus with slowly varying refractive index 
                              in the backcattered signals. Based on our Fourier mapping approach, nanoNAM computes the Fourier phase associated with these back-scattered waves 
                              to capture, with nanoscale sensitivity, (a) depth-resolved alterations in mean optical density, and (b) depth-resolved localized heterogeneity 
                              in optical density of the cell nuclei. This depth-resolved capability of nanoNAM allows 3D quantification of nuclear architecture, while 
                              simultaneously avoiding the confounding effect of thickness variation. We apply nanoNAM together with high-contrast quantitative phase imaging to explore its ability
                              to detect subtle structural changes in refractive index in cells undergoing early-stage carcinogenesis.

                              Although super-resolution microscopy is commercially available, it remains a high-end microscopy instrument only available in the core imaging centers at major academic institutions 
                              and a small number of well-funded laboratories around the world. The high cost of this technology limits its widespread use as a routine microscopy system. Small colleges and 
                              commercial laboratories often cannot afford such expensive instruments. We aim to develop miniSTORM, an affordable state-of-the-art nanoscopy with a spatial resolution one 
                              order-of-magnitude better than conventional light microscopy. The hardware cost will be 10 times lower than commercial systems. It is compact and can be put on a regular table 
                              top without a dedicated room and high-end optical table. It is highly robust and automated. Importantly, miniSTORM integrates artifact minimization modules that provide 
                              high-quality image, it will reduce the learning curve and the need for significant user expertise.

                              Light-sheet microscopy is a powerful approach to minimize photobleaching effect and reduce the out-of-focus background. However, the physical constraint of the objective limits
                              the use of high-NA optics, thus limiting the optical resolution. Significant progress has been made in the development of high-resolution light-sheet systems. Our group aims to 
                              develop simple high-resolution light-sheet microscopy systems for 3D live-cell imaging for various biomedical applications.

                              Cancer risk stratification—identifying subjects at high risk for developing cancer—is an important tool 
                              in cancer prevention and early detection, and crucial for reducing cancer-related morbidity and mortality. 
                              However, due to the immense molecular heterogeneity at each stage of carcinogenesis, few tools are available 
                              to accurately identify the small percentage of subjects at the highest risk for developing cancer and 
                              who would benefit most from early detection and cancer prevention strategies. Higher-risk pre-cancerous 
                              lesions destined to undergo progression to cancer may be indistinguishable from low-risk precursors. Uncertain cancer 
                              risk can lead to sub-optimal clinical management of at-risk patients: high-risk patients may undergo inadequate 
                              surveillance, whereas the lower-risk subjects may undergo excessive testing or unnecessary interventions.

                              Abnormal chromatin structure is one of the most universal and striking characteristics in cancer cells and 
                              has remained the gold standard for cancer diagnosis for two centuries, but it often lacks sufficient 
                              sensitivity to accurately identify patients at highest risk for developing cancer, and cells early carcinogenesis 
                              may not appear pathologically distinct. Further, tumor microenvironment (TME) also plays an indispensable role 
                              in the disease progression. Comprised of a dynamic interplay among emerging tumor cells, local stromal cells, the 
                              extracellular matrix, and signaling molecules, the TME in precursors can provide early cues about the potential 
                              for a lesion to transition towards malignancy. Current technology does not offer a comprehensive view of 
                              chromatin abnormalities in the context of the tumor microenvironment.

                              We aim to apply our multi-scale multi-modal imaging into cancer risk stratification, by detecting the cumulative disruption in chromatin folding 
                              coupled with their tumor microenvironment to characterize the risk of precursors progressing to malignancy. We are applying these techniques in cancer risk stratification of colon polyps, early detection of lung cancer and detection of aggressive prostate cancer.

                              Cancer cells respond to a therapeutic agent and develop resistance over time with various phenotypic representations. The phenotype of an individual cell is determined 
                              by its functional state, abundance, morphology, and dynamic behavior of its organelles. Therefore, it is important to understand such diverse phenotypic transitions for a large cell population 
                              over the duration of drug treatment. Traditional techniques based on high-content microscopy generally capture a snapshot of the dynamic process, while missing the critical information about 
                              the cell morphologic changes in live cells. On the other hand, label-free live-cell imaging captures the dynamic changes of cellular morphology but missing high-content molecular information. 
                              To understand the molecular characteristics of morphological dynamics, we have developed a unique multi-scale multimodal mesoscopic imaging system that is capable of label-free quantitative 
                              phase imaging of live cells for real-time dynamic tracking of morphological features and hyperplex high-content fluorescence imaging across a wide-range of spatial scales from mesoscale to nanoscale. 
                              Leveraging this powerful platform, we aim to identify factors contributing to resistance in cancer treatments and develop more effective therapeutic approaches.

                              Eukaryotic cells package genomic DNA up to 2 meters long into a nucleus with a diameter of several microns through a hierarchical 
                              scheme of compaction into DNA-protein assemblies. The first level is nucleosome, consisting of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 
                              around an octamer of four core histone proteins. This basic repeating unit of nucleosomes is then organized into ~10 nm “beads-on-string” 
                              chromatin fiber, which is further compacted into higher-order chromatin structure, to fit into the micron-sized nucleus. Chromatin 
                              organization is regulated by a large number of chemical modifications, particularly on the N-terminal tails of histone core proteins, 
                              such as acetylation and methylation. Histone modifications regulate the packaging of nucleosomes into higher-order chromatin structure 
                              to influence the accessibility of genomic DNA to the transcription machinery proteins. Subsequently, chromatin compaction at different 
                              epigenomic states controls their gene expression and imposes a significant effect on many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, 
                              cell division, DNA damage and DNA repair. We apply powerful super-resolution microscopy and genomic technologies (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq) to 
                              study higher-order chromatin organization at differnet epigenomic states and aim to understand how chromatin organization coordinates 
                              with co-factors to impact gene expression in normal cellular processes and pathological states.
